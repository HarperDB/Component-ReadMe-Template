<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This section should include instruction on how a developer can setup the project and run it locally. 

Below is an example of what this should look like. 


### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct developers on installing and setting up your component._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)

2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API key in `.env file`
   ```js
   API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
5. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```
